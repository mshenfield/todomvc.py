# Roadmap
Build a "full-stack python" web-app.

## Good Web-App
_:pats:_

* Fast time to first paint
* Small
* React-like
* Offline friendly
* Universal (shared server-side and client-side)

## Good Python App

* Normalized data
* Expressive API
* Versioned API
* GraphQL?

## Existing Resources 
http://stromberg.dnsalias.org/~strombrg/pybrowser/python-browser.html - allow filtering.  Make prettier?
* PythonScript -> Rusthon https://github.com/rusthon/Rusthon
* Allow filtering, "Hide Row/HideColum" -> collapse icon, allow altering spacing. Maybe available as a better plugin or a google sheet.
