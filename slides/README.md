# PyNash 2018-04-26 Presentation

This presentation was given at Nashville's vigrant [PyNash](http://pynash.org/) meetup.  It gives an opinionated overview of Python to JS options, and includes time to demo the [brython+browser TodoMVC implementation](../brython+browser).

The slides were created with [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

## Running

Run `yarn install` in this directory, and then fire up your favorite "server in a box" - `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` should work on most Mac laptops.
