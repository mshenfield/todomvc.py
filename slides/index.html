          <h1>Python in the Browser</h1>
          <h2>A Guide for Intrepid Pythonistas</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            Let's get started.

            The web is an expressive and flexible medium for writing
            rich applications.  Most of you probably write web applications
            using a frontend framework like React or Vue. Today we'll be talking
            about an exciting alternative for adventurous Pythonistas,
            writing frontend web apps with Python!

              I was really excited at the idea of Python in the Browser,
              and after writing this talk I'm sobered, but still excited

              use that as motiviation to improve the ecosystem.

              I'll then demo a Todo List app built entirely with Python and
              show how some of it was built.  Afterwards, we'll talk about
              the ecosystem of Python to JavaScript transpilation tools, and
              deep dive into two of them, Brython and Transcrypt.  Finally,
              we'll have a few minutes for questions at the end.

              JavaScript still kind of sucks.  It's greatest asset is that
              we've been forced to use it, and so it has an astoundingly

              This is the text input for generating a new Todo, using a
              Python interpreter called Brython.

              There are a few things to call out.  The tool I'm using has a
              simple wrapper called `html`, which exposes classes for
              all DOM elements.  In this case we're creating a customized
              &ltinput> tag, with a key-up listener that generates a new
              `Todo` instance and clears the input when you press "Enter".

              <p>
                You can see we're able to use Python to glue together a DOM
              interaction with our data model pretty easily.  With Brython,
              the tools and semantics are very similar.

            <p>  `attrs` is a third party library that brings back the joy
              of writing classes. The `attr` dot `s` decorator at the top
              uses the `attr` dot `ib` class variables to construct a class

              There isn't a perfect Python to JavaScript solution out there
              ...yet (press down).

              <p>
              To qualify as Python to JavaScript, the syntax actually has to
              look like Python.  This means almost every library implements
              standard python syntax, and features tied closely to syntax,
              like basic <code>class</code>es, <code>yield</code>, and
              list comprehensions.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we talk about behavior, we mean the behavior as seen
              in CPython, the <code>Python</code> interpreter most of us
              are familiar with. A typical tradeoff is (clicks on each)
              native JS speed and easier interop, but sacrificing semantics
              that are expensive or clunky to implement in JavaScript,
              such as operator overloading, or non-string dictionary keys.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other side (unchecks boxes), existing solutions that
              implement Python behavior (checks) and stdlib or 3rd party
              lib support haven't figured out how to do it fast yet.

              Getting set up is easy. `pip install transcrypt` and run it

              it runs into - but be warned, they might not behave as expected.

            <aside class="notes">
              The choice to embrace the JS ecosystem is pragmatic,
              and the Transcrypt tool itself is well developed.

              Python's batteries included approach means a hefty
              standard library.  For Transcrypt, this means embracing
              the giant JavaScript ecosystem.  This means it's easy
              to take advantage of React or Vue, but it also means
              it's much harder to experiment with Python tools on
              the frontend, and you have to be more conscious of
              JS drawbacks.

                Really the main drawback of Transcrypt is the lack of Python
                semantics.  Transcrypt supports basic python syntax, but
                basic facilities like operator overloading, automatic truth value
                conversion and named parameters have to be switched on and off
                locally.  In addition, Transcrypt dicts are actually JavaScript
                objects, so don't support non-string values.
              </p>

              <p>
                (press down)
                Here's a quick example of what it takes to turn on
                named parameters in Transcrypt - it has to be called
                in the module, and whenever any callers want to use
                named parameters.
              </p>

              <p>
                You can use a flag to the command line tool
                to globally enable or disable various Python semantics,
                such as <code>-k</code> to turn on keyword arguments
                for every function.  I'd like to see something in the future
                that allowed you to configure transcrypt at the module
                level, so that behavior wasn't dependent on a command line
                flag.

            <h1>Brython</h1>
            <p><a href="http://brython.info">brython.info</a></p>
            <p>An in-browser Python interpreter that allows you to run <code>&ltscript type="text/python"></code></p>

              <p>
                Brython runs an entire Python interpeter in the browser,
                which allows you to use scripts of type <code>text/python</code>.
                Part of Brython's goal is Python interop - it's behavior is
                much closer to the CPython experience, and stdlib support is
                significantly better than Transcrypt.

                It's a fun and heady experience to just be able to run some Python,
                but it does have some serious drawbacks in terms of performance.

              mkdir myproject && cd myproject
              pip install brython
              # Create a new folder with your brython app
              python -m brython --install
              #â”œâ”€â”€ demo.html
              #â”œâ”€â”€ brython.js
              #â”œâ”€â”€ brython_stdlib.js
              python -m brython --server

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                Brython's setup is a little more involved.  You can install it
                using `pip` or `npm` - the module itself is basically a scaffolding
                and project management tool.
              </p>

              <p>
                The project generates a directory with the Brython JS interpreter
                and, separately, the portion of the std python library it implements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Brython also has the ability to add a third party library or
                package from the standard library to the project. Note that
                you can't transpile Brython directly - you have to load it
                in the browser for now.

            <h1>Pros</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>Standard and third party libary support</li>
              <li>Less thinking about JavaScript</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              Standard and third party library support means you
              can use some of the tools you already enjoy in
              the browser.  There's also more potential for code
              sharing between the backend and the frontend.

              <p>
                Brython hides JavaScript better.

              <li>Trickier to debug</li>
              <li>Messier docs</li>
              <li><code>browser</code> is probably a mis-step</li>
              <li>Slow (more on next slide)</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              Because the source code is transpiled and executed on the fly,
              browser debugging and code exploration tools don't always work.
              The best option is to print out stacktraces on errors.

              <p>
                The documentation is a little harder to parse through than
                Transcrypt - it needs a little love and organization.
              </p>

              <p>
                The <code>browser</code> module you saw earlier makes it
                easier to interact with the DOM, but is probably a mis-step.
                It's built in by default, but the DOM manipulation is
                less intuitive than jQuery, and DOM manipulation as a whole
                is less preferable to anything that uses a VirtualDOM like
                React.

              <p>
                Slow - we'll see more in the next slide.

            <aside class="notes">
              These graphs are for PyPy.js, but they capture the main
              problems of Brython as well.  The interpreter with standard
              library is heavy, about 3.5 mb.  Hence you run into
              multi-second load times.  When you add in libraries
              that are loaded and transpiled on the fly, you quicly
              get an app that is non-performant without some manual
              tweaking.

              <p>
                Brython has a primitive bundler, but it isn't well
                documented and doesn't match the power of WebPack, a common
                JavaScript bundling utility. The current state is that
                if you aren't using built-in brython and JavaScript utilites,
                performance is a serious issue.

            There are a lot of Python to JavaScript options available, I
            wanted to quickly call out a few other popular or unique ones.

            PyPy.js is a port of PyPy, an alternative Python compiler, that
            runs in the browser, and runs Python 2.7. Unfortunately the project lost its lead
            recently.

            Skulpt is similar to Brython, but currently only supports Python 2.7.
            It has an active community in education, and has been used to
            implement in browser REPLs for web books and tutorials.

            PyJamas is a now defunct project implemented a Python to JS transpiler
            and widget toolkit.
            It's something I'm interested in exploring, but it hasn't been
            actively developed in a few years.

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            I was really excited at the idea of Python in the Browser,
            and after writing this talk I'm sobered, but still excited
            and chomping at the bit to write a real app with this and
            use that as motiviation to improve the ecosystem. I think
            there's a lot of room to grow to make Python in the browser
            a seamless experience.

            Some things I'm interested in exploring:

            <ul>
              <li>Making Brython compatible with WebPack</li>
              <li>Auto-detecting feature usage for Transcrypt</li>
              <li>Implementing a Python JSX using the Python AST module</li>
              <li>Building a full stack Python project with Transcrypt, WebPack, and React</li>
            </ul>
