## Todos

* PYX - JSX transformer that compiles to Python instead of JavaScript

## Development Experience:

* Editor to experience

Experiences that can be improved:

* Limited editor support
* No browser console integration

## Document abstraction is just one idea
There have been many in the JS, and this just isn't good enough.


`syntax error, super().__init__ L58` means "You're missing a comma"

Silent failures - example: calling a class with the wrong kwargs in a generator.

## JS is better

* DOM API is limited -> jQuery
* No DOM manipulation - full stop - React, Angular,  Vue.js
